1	1-1	Claire	Wife	clair.wife@TOJam.com	Anniversary Present	Hey Freddie. Last week you asked me what kind of jewelry I wanted for our anniversary and I said I’d think about it. I know how much shopping makes you anxious but you know me, I’m not that picky and anything you pick will be amazing. Something I don’t have yet would be perfect, like an amethyst ring or some sapphire earrings. Love you, happy almost three years together! Claire.

2	2-2	Claire	Wife	clair.wife@TOJam.com	Christmas Shopping	Thanks for agreeing to do all the shopping for Christmas; I know it's not your favourite but I really appreciate you giving me so much time to work on my game, it’s about a guy who hates shopping (just like you :P). When in doubt, you can never go wrong with jewels, or maybe some of my favourite flowers (Camillas or Gardenias in case you forgot ^_^). Love you! Claire.

2	2-3	George	FIL	george.father-in-law@TOJam.com	Farm Christmas	Hi Sport. Jean told me that you kids are coming down to the farm for Christmas. I don’t want anything too fancy, maybe just something that can help me with all the fixing-up I plan to do here. Might be good if it's something small enough that Jean won’t have to see it all the time hahaha! You know how she is about all those old cars sitting in the field. I keep telling her they’re vintage, isn’t that what kids are into these days? Hahaha.	Help with DIY, Small	6-2-3	6-3-4		FALSE	Vintage/rustic bench vice
2	2-4	Jean	mother-in-law	jean.mother-in-law@TOJam.com	Hi...	Hi Fred... It’s nice that you and Clair are coming to the farm for Christmas.... We’ve had a lot of snow, hopefully Lucy has fun.... I’m not very picky about gifts, I like things that are cozy, maybe with some colours that remind you that spring is coming... Looking forward to seeing you...

3	3-4	George	father-in-law	george.father-in-law@TOJam.com	Surprise for Jean	Hey Sport. This year for the holidays I’m going to surprise Jean by saying goodbye to all my cars in the back field. She’s always teasing me about them and I think it’s time hahaha. I think I only kept them around for nostalgia, but I think that after all of these decades in the snow they probably aren’t going to run again hahaha. The only one I’ll really miss is my yellow Autoblitz; it was the first car I ever owned and has a lot of memories. I guess I’ll probably have to find another hobby rather than staring at all those cars hahaha.	???	1-4-4	1-4-1; 1-4-2; 1-4-3	Older model of 2-4	FALSE

3	3-9	Roxanne	Sister IL	roxanne.sister-in-law@TOJam.com	HI FRED	OH MY GOD, FRED, HOW. ARE. YOU? Its been too long, so excited to catch up over the holidays. Life is busy, has Dave told you about my new job? I bet he forgot, you know how he is. Did he tell you about Julian’s new school? He probably forgot that to. Its like he doesn’t even focus on all the words I’m saying sometimes can you believe that? Anyway I’d like something with a bit of wow you know what I mean? Something that screams ME. I like everything I own to have some flair and to really pop. See you soon!!!	Screams "me", Wow, Flair, Pop	4-3-4	4-3-1; 4-3-2; 4-3-3; 3-1-7		FALSE	"Bit of an artist".

I bet his gift is something for Emma and I, he’s always so thoughtful! This year I want something to help me get ready for triathlon season; maybe in my favourite colour? <3 Love you! Lucy.

3	3-1	Ken	Son IL	ken.son-in-law@TOJam.com	New TV?	Hi dad. Looking forward to another holiday season at the farm, hopefully the snow is deep enough that it will cover all of George’s works-in-progress xD.  This year it would be great if we could get a new TV, our old one doesn’t have enough HDMI ports for all of the devices I want to plug in. At least four would be great, and no bigger than 50”, you remember how small our living room is. Also, some of those fancy picture-enhancing features would be cool, some of the new ones have super black blacks. Best, Ken. 	TV, At Least 4 HDMI Ports, No Larger Than 50'', Fancy Features	2-1-3	2-1-1; 2-1-5	Can we make this character not-white?		(Early in level to tutorial concept of description) Wants a new TV.

3	3-2	Claire	Wife	clair.wife@TOJam.com	Love you!	Hey Freddie. I hope you’re not too stressed about doing the gift shopping this year, I know you’ll do great! Frankfurt is amazing and I’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback demoing the new game. I know I always say that jewelry is fine (and it still is! ^_^), but I was thinking that I could try and recreate that dish that we had on our honeymoon in Korea for our next anniversary, wouldn’t that be fun?! Anyway, looking forward to whatever you get me! Love, Claire.
